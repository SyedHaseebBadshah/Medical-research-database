## Medical Research Database

A web-based system for managing clinical trial data, patient records, study results, and drug information. This project provides a secure, interactive platform for researchers to store and analyze data, track study metadata, and generate insights.

### Features
- **Manage Clinical Trials**: Add and store clinical trial details.
- **Patient Records**: Maintain a database of patient details, including age and medical conditions.
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Generate insights like total trials and patient counts.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized user interface with clean, professional styling.
- **Database Integration**: Data is securely stored using MySQL.

### Project Development Stages (SDLC Phases):
#### 1.	Planning:
-	Identified project objectives: 
-	Enable efficient management of clinical trial data.
-	Provide secure storage for patient records and study metadata.
-	Defined scope based on user requirements provided by research professionals.

#### 2.	Analysis:
-	Conducted requirements analysis to understand data relationships, such as between patients, trials, and study results.
-	Identified necessary tables: trials, patients, studies, results, drugs, and metadata.

#### 3.	Design:
-	Created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for visualizing the database schema.
-	Applied normalization techniques to minimize redundancy and optimize storage.
-	Designed security features to protect sensitive data.

#### 4.	Implementation:
-	Used [specific DBMS, e.g., MySQL] to develop the database schema and implement the tables.
-	Inserted sample data for testing purposes.
-	Implemented core features: 
-	Managing clinical trial data and results.
-	Storing patient records securely.
-	Analyzing data trends.

#### 5.	Testing:
-	Performed functionality testing to ensure accurate data retrieval and updates.
-	Tested edge cases for data integrity and security (e.g., invalid inputs).

#### 6.	Deployment:
-	Prepared a demonstration for presenting the working database system to academic supervisors.
- Provided clear documentation, including database schema and user instructions.

#### 7.	Maintenance:
-	Proposed future maintenance strategies: 
-	Regular cleaning of outdated or non-relevant data.
-	Enhancing features like auto-spelling correction and real-time updates for ongoing trials.
-	Integrating dashboards for statistical analysis.
